# Sorting-Algo-Visualiser

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer project is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, providing a graphical representation of the sorting process.<br>
<br>
Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project demonstrates the inner workings of sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort, by animating the comparisons and swaps that occur during the sorting process.<br>
<br>
Users can interact with the visualizer by selecting different array sizes, speed settings, and sorting algorithms, gaining a deeper understanding of how these algorithms operate and their respective time complexities.<br>
